"""Every game function a harness test compiles from the sources (`function`, `inline`) is still called by the game:
a test of a function nothing calls any more proves nothing about the game. This stands in for the per-test checks
that a call's text is where it was ("wired"), which broke on every rename and merge: the names come from the tests
themselves, so a rename that the tests follow is followed here too."""
