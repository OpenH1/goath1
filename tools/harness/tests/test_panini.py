"""display.panini (port/linux/include/panini_projection.h, port/linux/game/panini.c): the Panini projection's forward
and inverse round trips at every strength, vertical compression and field of view; d 0 and s 0 the rectilinear view;
the view's sides at the screen's sides, vertical lines straight, the middle magnified by the scale (1.5 at 120 degrees,
2.43 at 150); the rectilinear view covering the whole screen through it; a thing on the horizon keeping its shape at
full strength; what the HUD places over a point (render_camera_view_to_screen) where the pass draws it, a split
screen's off-centre view too; the middle's magnification only while a window is drawn through it; off, nothing; the
waypoints' arrows. The pass's GLSL has the same arithmetic."""
